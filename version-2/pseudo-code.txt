:brain: VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
-------------------------------------
This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:
1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   List the key/value pair, data type, example value.
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?
3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?
4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
    - render anything in JSX?
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
    - set or get an item from localStorage?
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language.
:sparkles: YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.
